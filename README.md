# Gladiator-Project
Welcome to the Gladiator Project!

Gladiator-Project is a project inspired by the populair turn-based gladiator game series Swords and Sandals. 
This project is fully made in python using the open source library for making games pygame-ce.

# Goal of the project
The goal of the projcet is to make a game using pygame-ce that recreates the ideas and the spirit of the game series Swords and sandals.
I chose to base this project off of Swords and Sandals 2. The idea is to create a recreation of Swords and Sandals 2 in pygame-ce with our
own take to it, our own ideas.
